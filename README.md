# Semester Project - 4th Semester - Other Perspective

### SUMMARY

In today’s world everybody is different from each other and these differences depend on many factors, 
as race, nationality or even gender. This brings about that every human has their own mindset and perspective 
which can differ absolutely compared to others’. But besides considerations mentioned above, 
there are also many issues that cause the viewpoint of given person to be literally different and 
impossible to understand from the outside. <br/><br/>
These so-called perception disorders wield influence on a person, making them perceive the world unlike anybody else. 
In order to let others understand this, there are already many books written about these topics, 
much information can be also found in media as well but it can be not enough to give a possibility to imagine it fully. <br/><br/>
Other Perspective, a VR application has its purpose set to achieve this goal by simulating these issues. This way, 
its users have a chance to get a truly immersive view that could let them put themselves in the shoes of a 
person with given perception disorder.
